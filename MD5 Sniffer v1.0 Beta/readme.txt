MD5 Sniffer v1.0 Beta

I've written an Olly plugin "MD5 Sniffer" which can test MD5 hashes on app data directly. Just select the data to be hashed in any Olly dump window, right click to select "MD5 Sniffer" and the MD5 hash result is displayed in Ascii format. The sniffer result is also copied to the Olly log for later reference or copying to the clipboard.

The screenshot shows an example of the MD5 Sniffer result in ImToo MPEG Encoder matching the MD5 hash generated by the app itself - proving that the data selected in the dump window is the data used by the app to generate the MD5 hash.
