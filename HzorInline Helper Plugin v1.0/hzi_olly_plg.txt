1. Owerview
===========
This plugin is created to automate the process of
generating patch commands for HzorInline tool.

2. How to use
=============
Unpack/Crack the target and generate patch strings
by selecting patched area either in CPU or in
any DUMP window, right-clicking on it and selecting
the "HzorInline Helper -> Add to list" command.
After you successfully add all needed areas, in the
table list window do right-click and select "Copy all".
Now you have all you need in your own clipboard, just
paste it's contents in the HzorInline patch editing window.

3. How to compile
=================
The plugin was successfully compiled with Open Watcom C/C++ v1.6
compiler. Before, you need to set in Compiler Options the
structure alignment to "1-byte alignment" ("-zp1" compiler option)
and also set the "80386 stack based calling" option ("-3s" 
compiler option).

I suppose this plugin can be also successfully compiled with Mingw32, 
lcc32, M$ and Borland compilers if needed.

4. Contacts
===========
Only E-mail atm...
