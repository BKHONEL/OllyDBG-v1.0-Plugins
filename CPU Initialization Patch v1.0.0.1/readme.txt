CPU Initialization Patch v1.0.0.1 by Blurcode

This is a plugin for OllyDbg 1.10, which hot-patches Olly's code to resolve the issue of OllyDbg taking 100% CPU time as soon as the debugged process is running (i.e. after having pressed F9 inside OllyDbg).

If nothing else, this problem causes any laptop that you might be reversing on to lose much more battery life than necessary, and also to sound like a jet plane due to constant maximum fan rotation, so this plugin will come in hand for any laptop reversers at least.
