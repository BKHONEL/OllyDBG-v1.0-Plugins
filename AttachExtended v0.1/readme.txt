This is a really small plugin that I have written for improving attach feature of OllyDbg.

With this plugin, you can attach to process by identifing its PID directly, not only selecting process list. In addition, you can find PID of process by dragging a small cursor on each window (This can be used on some protection which remove process from process list like GameGuard).
