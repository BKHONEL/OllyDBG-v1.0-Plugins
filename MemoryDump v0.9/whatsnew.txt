       -= Memory Dump for Olly Debugger by AeoN =-
       -=========================================-



Installation
============
 Copy plugin into Olly's plugin directory.


Usage & Help
============

 In the dump window right click and select 'Memory Dump' in the popup menu 
 pick your choice.

 Possible choices are:

 - File
    Copies selected bytes from dump into a file.
			
 - Clipboard
    Copies selected bytes from dump into a clipboard (text only).

 - Delphi/Pascal Table
    Generates table of selected bytes which can be easily used in Delphi/Pascal

 - C/C++ Table
    Generates table of selected bytes which can be easily used in C/C++

 - ASM Table
    Generates table of selected bytes which can be easily used in Assembler 
    (MASM Tested)

 - Visual Basic Table
    Generates table of selected bytes which can be easily used in Visual Basic 

 - Range Dump
    Dumps Range of defined bytes by: 

	- Lenght : Tick End Address/Lenght
        - End Address : Untick End Address/Lenght

    Xor Dump With: Self-explanatory 
	
    Button with [<] symbol enters address of last byte clicked(not selected) in the dump,
    it's more convenient than entering addresses manually.


 - Xor Selection
    Xors Selection and shows dumped data in Olly's window. This window cannot be used 
    for another byte manipulation with plugin because dump is created in your Win's 
    temporary folder and not in memory.
