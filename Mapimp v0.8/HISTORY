Version info:
	+ added
	* fixed
	- removed

 0.8:
	* fixed memory leak in mask_apply function
	* finally fixed quantifiers' deadlock bug. Match limit modification partially solved
	  the problem, but the actual reason was in the filtering behaviour (or rather my
	  crooked hands)
	* former dontreadme said that the order of mask applying is undefined which wasn't
	  actually true: they were applied in the order of appearance in the list. Now list
	  sorting is disabled which allows you to build mask chains. Intersection is no more
	  a problem
	+ added "Insert" function for mask manager
	+ now you can move masks through the list. Use Ctrl + Up/Ctrl + Down for moving Up/Down
	  and Ctrl + PgUp/Ctrl + PgDown for moving to the beginning/to the end respectively
	* recompiled using static rtl. It doesn't have redistrubutable package dependency anymore
	* pcre library updated to 8.02. See http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt
	* fixed some minor gui bugs
	* improved stability

 0.7:
	- removed "Add, "Edit" and "Delete" buttons and implemented context menu for mask
	  manager
	+ now it is possible to save/load mask list alone. Availible from context menu and
	  with key shortcuts Ctrl + S/Ctrl + L for "save" and "load" operations respectively
	  (thanks to Jupiter for the idea)
	* fixed a bug in mask_filter function. Local buffers were too short to hold
	  some names' parts. That caused stack corruption and thus crash
	* pcre library updated to 8.01. See http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt
	* recompiled pcre with PCRE_MATCH_LIMIT set to MAXBUFLEN which default value of
	  10000000 or something like that caused a deadlock while using assertions, strong
	  quantifiers like * and so on. Now all regular expressions seem to be working ok

 0.6: (contributed by BoRoV/TSRh)
	+ now doubleclick on a mask opens edit dialog
	* better solution for preventing autoimport feature to ask to load/load map file
	  every session. Now it makes corresponding record in the udd
	* fixed a bug in autoimport which made OllyDbg crash while trying to debug files
	  with no extension (spotted by sendersu, thanks)

 0.5:
	+ added name demangling feature
	+ now it is possible to choose whether to apply names to debugged module or
	  currently viewed module
	* map file parsing routine was a hack and so rewriten. Should now support IDA,
	  DeDe, IDR, Microsoft and Borland (thanks to void and awerto for CodeGear tests)
	  linkers' map files and handle names longer than 235 characters (string buffer is
	  now 1kb long)
	* pcre library updated to 8.0. See http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt
	* fixed a bug when mapimp broke import procedure while trying to import a name to a
	  module with less number of segments than the name's segment addressed
	* fixed a bug when OllyDbg crashed while displaying format containing names in the
	  progress bar
	* fixed a bug with an accelerators when it was unable to check\uncheck checkboxes
	  using a mouse click. The winner of "The stupidest bug of a year" award
	* fixed a bug in autoimport feature which made it search for the map file every
	  int3 break event including step over (thanks to 9999 for the report)
	* fixed "Options" window look with Windows themes (thanks to BoRoV for the report)
	* config file moved to plugins folder

 0.4:
	* fixed map file parsing routine. Now you can load some
	  structure-incorrect map files like those which Interactive Delphi
	  Reconstructor exports
	* fixed a bug with global shortcuts. ODBG_Pluginshortcut callback
	  works reeeally weird. Now press Ctrl + Shift + I to import
	  and Ctrl + Shift + M to open options window

 0.3:
	+ added keyboard shortcuts
	* fixed memory leak in mask_filter function
	* fixed mask manager's focus and selection behaviour
	* fixed a bug when being closed "Options" window did not return focus
	  to OllyDbg's main window if it temporarily lost activity
	* now autoimport does not search for the map file until debugee changes
	* code refactored

 0.2:
	+ added autoimport feature (thanks to Jupiter for the idea)
	+ added "Edit" button for mask manager
	* more informative regular expression error messages
	* fixed a bug when mapimp did not make the "Options" window modal while
	  inputing masks. So if you closed the options window with active input
	  box it caused a deadlock
	* some interface changes

 0.1:
	+ first release
