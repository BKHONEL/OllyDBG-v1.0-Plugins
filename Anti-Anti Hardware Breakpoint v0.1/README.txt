- * How to use it?

If the target doesn't use user32.dll :
	When you load a program do a F7 or F8 and in the menu and Force to load the dll.

Else it's good :)

If you wanna remove the hook in ntdll goto the menu and Remove the hook :].

- * Note?

Yep, it's a simple version. I load the dll like a pig :]
