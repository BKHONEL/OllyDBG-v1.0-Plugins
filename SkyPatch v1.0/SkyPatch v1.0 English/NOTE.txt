you want to know what it is?

its basically an improved version of nonawrite. (except the save button does jack shit unless you open a script first, ie. if you just write a patch and press save it tells you no file name specified.)


ive translated SkyPatch.dll (not just the buttons) the test1.odp (example patch script) and the readme. (nothing better to do, its cold and raining)

the translation is a little dodgy, but you will get the general idea, at least its readable.

not sure if it use is the same as nonawrite i dont use it.


feel free to try it before duly dumping it in the recycle bin
