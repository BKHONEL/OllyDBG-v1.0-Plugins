Break On Execution Plugin for Olly Debugger v1.10
__________________________________________________

What does it do?
It patches Olly so memory breakpoints stop only on execution and not when reading or writing.
You can restore and patch again anytime. Auto-patching on startup is not implemented.

How to install?
Just place BreakOnExecution.dll inside the Plugins folder of Olly.
