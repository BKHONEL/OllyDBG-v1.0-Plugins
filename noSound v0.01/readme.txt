Hi to all, a friend of mine asked me if i coud code him a plugin to disable
sound in crackmes that sound terible while stepping through codes..

So i coded one simple plugin to do just that.. it patches winmm.dll
and it only works in XP SP2. It has not been tested on anything else.

If someone wants the source to improve it, just PM me.
