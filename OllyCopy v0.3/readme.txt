Here is a little plugin that I made for OllyDbg v1.10. It enables you to copy only the address of either the selected instruction in the disassembler window, selected line in the stack window or any kind of data (byte, word, dword, etc.) selected in the dump window (this applies to all of the dump windows, not just the one under the disassembler window).
