What's new in uhooker v1.3?
===========================

-Several bug fixes, everything should work better than before :)

-Fixed bug with readunicode() API where reading empty multibyte strings,
resulted in the plugin freezing for ever.

-Now you can load multiple .CFG files (load one, then load another to hook
something else, etc). Previously, you were only allowed to load one .CFG file
with breakpoints/handlers definitions. Now you can load as many as you like
whenever you want.

	-If a .CFG file overlaps previously set hooks, you have the chance
	to redefine them (for example, you can dinamically change the
        file/function handling the breakpoint. This adds to the feature
        present since the first version of uhooker that allows runtime rewriting
        of the handler's code).


-Errors in the code of the handlers (written in python) are now correctly handled.
		
		-Previously, if you had an error in the code you wrote to handle
		certain breakpoint, this caused the 'uhooker's python server' to
 		'crash', and you needed to restart your debugging session all over
		again.

		This scenario was very common, particuarly if you were developing
		your own handler/script for the first time, or if you were
		modifying at runtime the code of a handler/script.


		Well, no more! :), Now if you have an error (syntax error,
		identation error, general programming error,etc), the error that
		your handler has will be displayed on the uhooker's console, and
		you'll be able to recover from that error. This improvement means:

				1-If an error occurs on the code, you don't 
				need to restart the debugger's session (and lose
				the state of the program, etc.). 

				2-If you are changing in runtime the code of the
				handler, and you makee a mistake, you'll see what
				caused the error, and you can fix the script/handler
				and move on!.

		
-and there are probably more things but I didn't write them down and now I dont't remember :).
