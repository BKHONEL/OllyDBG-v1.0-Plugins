This is uhooker v1.3.
for the latest version of the documenation see: http://oss.coresecurity.com/uhooker/doc/index.html
This page also contains the "API reference", sample scripts, videos
showing how the program works and what it can do, and more,
so it is a good idea to visit the page frequently.
