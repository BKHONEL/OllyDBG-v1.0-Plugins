                        SoftICE keys for Immunity Debugger

        Who has ever used SoftICE will, and probably still finds OllyDbg and 
ImmunityDebugger key mapping confusing. Guess what, I'm one of them. For Olly
we have Crudd[RET] modification which has SoftICE keys, and I'm using this Olly
version for a long long loooooong time with some custom patches. Recently, at
CodeGate 2012 we had to use ImmunityDebugger for a some challange, and I found
it very very veeeeeeery annoying to use default keys there, so I wrote this 
plugin which will map SoftICE keys to ImmunityDebugger so this debugger can be
used by users which are used to SoftICE keys (and also WinDbg keys).

Hope SoftICE and WinDbg users will find it useful...

To compile use WDK, and use FixPlugin.exe to convert OllyDbg plugin to Immunity
Plugin:

Note also that included plugin is fixed, so you can start using it with Immunity
without need to fix anything.
