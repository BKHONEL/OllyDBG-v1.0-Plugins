How to:
In DeDe you need to generate the map file and dump the project.  When you dump the project the events.txt will be created

About:
When I would come across a Delphi subject, I would always find myself loading up DeDe along side
Ollydbg so that I could quickly analyze Delphi library calls that I could just skip over.  This is a hassle
when you are trying to step through code.  I also found that DeDe didn't always generate code for some of the
functions.  Currently there is a plugin for importing MAP files into Olly, MapConv, and DeDe can export a MAP file
for this purpose.  HOwever I decided to take it a step further.  My plugin can also import the events.txt file created
by DeDe when you dump the project.  This gives the ability to find all references to objects and functions and note them
as such in comments.

If you find any bugs in the code please contact me on efnet, usually in #c4n.

Thanks to
