I've coded a small plugin to replace the standard bookmarks plugin, you can set custom hotkeys to toggle bookmark, navigate backward/forward.

The plugin will try to load the bookmarks set using the Bookmarks plugin that comes with Ollydbg (if any) to prevent that add these lines to ollydbg.ini

[Plugin OllyBkmrX]
Load Old bookmarks=0

If you don't like to show plugin window at Ollydbg startup then add these lines to ollydbg.ini

[Plugin OllyBkmrX]
Auto show=0
