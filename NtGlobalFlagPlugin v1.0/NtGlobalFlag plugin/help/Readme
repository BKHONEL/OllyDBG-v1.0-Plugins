NtGlobalFlagPlugin for ollydbg

author Stingduk

version 1.0

platforms w2k and above wont work on 95,98,and winme 

this plugin is intended to log all the window Ldr Emitted Debugstrings during process initialization stage in ollydbg log window

usage 

simply copy the dll to ollydbg directory or to the plugin path 
if you have specified one in options 

it should show up in plugin menu and ready to use

use SET_LDR_SHOW_SNAPS to set the global flag

if you have plugins that hide ollydbg like isDebugger present plugin
or hidedebugger plugin

you should choose yes to patch ntdll 

if you chose no debug strings wont be visible 

this plugin will work even before you load a debuggee so that you dont have to restart debuggee :)
if you set after loading a debuggee then you should restrat the debuggee to catch the strings

also while closing ollydbg this plugin will ask if you prefer to keep the setting for next session 

normally the strings are benign and dont offer much information
unless you are geek so choose no as keeping it active for debugging
simple apps like iczelions tut-o2 will make the process a little bit slower as the system has to format and print the strings :) 

any and all comments bug reports are welcome :)
my mail address is in one of the plugins message box :)

thanks and regards
